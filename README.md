Milestone Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is my second attempt at the project. 

The planning for this project can be found here:

## UX
My design goal with the site was to keep things simple and go with a mobile-first approach. The color scheme was chosen to be effiecent, easy to take in quickly and the white and blue associated with fitness along with some shades of orange to compliment them.

For clients, I wanted them to have quick access to the class timetable and they can access that with just one click from the landing page and with the links being very visible.

For potential new PT clients, I have have made the Personal training section of equal importance on the NavBar and again just one click away. 

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3)


## Features
This site contains a class timetable, working social media links and a contact form.


### Features Left to Implement
I would like to add testimonials from previous clients to the Personal Training page. More photos would help flesh out group classes information.


## Testing
The potential clients in the user stories can access their required information.

The contact section has the 'required' tags for the name, email and message section so these can't be left blank. The email section also needs to recognize a valid email address before you can submit.

The navbar connects all pages smoothly and was tested accross full device range.

The social media links connects to all relevant pages and was tested accross full device range.


## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/dof-bull/ci_milestone_project_1_Amy_Buckley_Fitness.git` into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
