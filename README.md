Milestone Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is my second attempt at the project. 

The planning for this project can be found here:

## UX
My design goal with the site was to keep things simple and go with a mobile-first approach. The color scheme was chosen to be effiecent, easy to take in quickly and the white and blue associated with fitness.

For clients, I wanted them to have quick access to the class timetable and they can access that with just one click from the landing page and with the links being very visible.

For potential new PT clients, I have have made the Personal training section of equal importance on the NavBar and again just one click away. 

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3)


## Features
This site contains built in audio files of the band's greatest hits and direct access to one of their music videos. A modal window is in place to get in contact with the band.


### Features Left to Implement
I still have elements to fully correct their functionality and to tidy up. I would also like to add some quotes for corporate and weddings customers in the booking section.

I still need to create the social media icon links. Have placeholder text in the left of the footer where I will put them in.


## Testing
The fans in the user stories can access to the music files as desired.

The booking form has the 'required' tags for the name, email and message section so these can't be left blank. The email section also needs to recognize a valid email address before you can submit. Accessing the modal window was also tested from all pages and all device sizes.

The navbar connects all pages smoothly and was tested accross full device range.


## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/dof-bull/ci_milestone_project_1_Vandal_Youth.git` into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.


## Credits

### Content
All  text content in this site were written by me on behalf of the fictional band VANDAL YOUTH. 

### Media
All photos, audio files and video links were given to me by my course provider. This are based on the famous band The Monkees

### Acknowledgements
All code used in this project was written by me, either in previous tutorials (such as the modal) or done during the course or during the project itself.

Exceptions:

The table element taken directly from Bootstrap though heavily adapted for audio purposes.

The video player element was based on the example (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp).
