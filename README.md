by Donal O'Farrell

Milestone Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

## UX
My design goal with the site was to keep things simple and go with a mobile-first approach. The color scheme was chosen to be effiecent, easy to take in quickly and the white and blue associated with fitness along with some shades of orange to compliment them.

For clients, I wanted them to have quick access to the class timetable and they can access that with just one click from the landing page and with the links being very visible.

For potential new PT clients, I have have made the Personal training section of equal importance on the NavBar and again just one click away. 

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3)


## Features
On the landing page (index.html) you can see the logo and trainer's name, have access to the navbar, segment on what the trainer provides including a direct link to the timetable, a picture of the trainer and access to the footer which contains a small about section, email of the trainer and links to social media.

On classes.html you can see the logo and trainer's name, have access to the navbar, the location of all classes with a direct link to google maps, info on classes, the timetables for each day and access to the footer which contains a small about section, email of the trainer and links to social media.

On personneltraining.html you can see the logo and trainer's name, have access to the navbar, a photo of personnel training and a segment on what the personnel training involves including a direct link to the contact page, and access to the footer which contains a small about section, email of the trainer and links to social media.

On contact.html you can see the logo and trainer's name, have access to the navbar, contact form with text asking what people may want to ask about and access to the footer which contains a small about section, email of the trainer and links to social media.


### Features Left to Implement
I would like to add testimonials from previous clients to the Personal Training page. More photos would help flesh out group classes information.

## User Stories

###### Story 1

Scenario: An existing client wants to get the latest class times.

Requirements:
Ability to access a class timetable.

###### Story 2

Scenario: A potential client wants to check what classes are available currently.

Requirements:
Ability to access a class timetable.

###### Story 3

Scenario: A potential client wants to hire a new PT.

Requirements:
Information regarding personal training.
Contact information.

###### Story 4

Scenario: Potential client with a special circumstances e.g. pregnant, injury, disability.

Requirements:
Contact information.


## Testing
The potential clients in the user stories can access their required information.

The contact section has the 'required' tags for the name, email and message section so these can't be left blank. The email section also needs to recognize a valid email address before you can submit.

The site performs as its meant to across Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge browsers.

The navbar connects all pages smoothly and was tested accross full device range.

The social media links connects to all relevant pages and was tested accross full device range.

### Bugs
No bugs as of current build.

Social media links were not working and a typo was discovered.

Bootstrap not loading probably so moved to bottom of HTML as best practice.
